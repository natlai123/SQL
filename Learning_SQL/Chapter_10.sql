/*Natural Join*/

/*You can choose a join type that allows you to name
the tables to be joined but lets the database server determine what the join conditions
need to be. Known as the natural join, this join type relies on identical column names
across multiple tables to infer the proper join conditions. For example, the account
table (25 rows) includes a column named cust_id, which is the foreign key to the customer table,
(13 rows) whose primary key is also named cust_id. Thus, you can write a query that uses natural
join to join the two tables:*/

SELECT a.account_id, a.cust_id, c.cust_type_cd, c.fed_id
FROM account a NATURAL JOIN customer c;
/* But better yet avoid using this join because if two tables do not share a same column name,
a Cross product is resulted */


/*Exercise 10-1
Write a query that returns all product names along with the accounts based on that
product (use the product_cd column in the account table to link to the product table).
Include all products, even if no accounts have been opened for that product.*/

/*Exercise 10-2
Reformulate your query from Exercise 10-1 to use the other outer join type (e.g., if you
used a left outer join in Exercise 10-1, use a right outer join this time) such that the
results are identical to Exercise 10-1.*/

to include are account.account_id, account.product_cd, individual.fname,
